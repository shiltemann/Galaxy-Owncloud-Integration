    This tool allows you to import one or more  files or directories from a registered
    `AARNet CloudStor`_ account. Transfers to/from CloudStor are encrypted over HTTPS.

    Before you can use this tool, you must perform a one-off task where you must provide Galaxy with credentials to access
    your CloudStor account on your behalf. You must first setup an app specific password in CloudStor for Galaxy to use.
    You must then let Galaxy know what that app password is.

    **Setting up an app password in CloudStor**

    To create an app password:

    Log into your account at https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au and then click on "Settings" in the top right corner of
    the interface. Once in Settings you will see a menu on the left, click "Security" and you will see a section
    called app passwords.

    App passwords simply require an "app name" this can be anything that helps you later identify the password in the
    future, for example "Galaxy". Fill in an "app name" and click "Create new app password". You will then be
    presented with a username and password/token. Your username will most probably be your email address and the
    password/token with be a randomly generated token. Please write this token down somewhere or copy it to your
    computer clipboard. When you click "Done" you will never be able to see this password/token again.

    Once the app password is created you will see it in the list of app passwords. You can also see when that password
    was last used as well as delete the app password.

    **Letting Galaxy know your app password**

    In Galaxy, go to your profile settings under the User menu -> Preferences -> Manage Information,
    where you will need to set OwnCloud/CloudStor Credentials.

    1. Server URL: https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/remote.php/webdav
    2. Username: The email your account is registered with
    3. Password: Copied from the app password set up at CloudStor

    If the details above are configured properly, the next time you load this tool, the files and directories
    in your CloudStor account will be displayed. Select the files or directory you want to Import and press
    Execute.

    .. class:: warningmark

    Your CloudStor credentials will be stored on this server. While reasonable efforts
    have been made to store these credentials safely, you must be aware and accept the risks of storing
    these credentials. In the event that the server is compromised, it may be possible for an attacker to
    gain access to your CloudStor account.
